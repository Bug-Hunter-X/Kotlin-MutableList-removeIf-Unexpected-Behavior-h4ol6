This example demonstrates a potential issue when using the `removeIf` function on mutable lists or sets in Kotlin.  The `removeIf` function iterates through the collection and removes elements based on a predicate. However, if the predicate itself modifies the collection (e.g., by adding or removing elements), the iterator's state can become invalid, leading to unexpected results. The solution involves creating a copy of the collection or using an alternative approach like filtering and assigning to a new collection.
